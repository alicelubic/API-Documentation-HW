1. What URL would use for an API call to retrieve photos recently posted near latitude 40.7128, longitude -74.0059?

GET https://api.instagram.com/v1/locations/search?lat=40.7128&lng=-74.0059&access_token=ACCESS-TOKEN

2. Click the "RESPONSE" button in the documentation to see a sample response for that API call. What key/value pairs would you need to use to find the number of "likes" a photo received? How many nested JSON objects would you need to traverse to find this information?  _(You don't need to write any code for this, just take a look at the structure of the JSON response and give a very quick description)_

We would need the "id": "788029" key/value pair to find the number of likes for that photo. 
We would need to traverse the root object, whose value is an array of objects, each of which shows the id key that will give us a photo.

3. Pretend you've sorted the photos by how many "likes" they received. Now, you want to get a list of users that liked the top photo in your list. What URL would you use for an API call to get a list of users who liked a specific photo?

GET https://api.instagram.com/v1/media/{media-id}/likes?access_token=ACCESS-TOKEN

4. Now, you want to show whether the user currently logged into your app has any relationship (follows, followed by, etc) with each user from the list you received from the previous API call. What URL would you use for an API call to get the relationship status between the current user and some other specified user?

GET https://api.instagram.com/v1/users/{user-id}/relationship?access_token=ACCESS-TOKEN

5. In the previous question, we wanted to get the current user's relationshp to not just one other user, but to each user in a list. Could we gather this data with a single API call, or would we need to make multiple API calls? How can you tell?

I think it would need to be multiple API calls ( I mean maybe not manually, maybe you can have some loop that loops through all the users and replaces the ID in the URL with their ID for each call). I'm actually a little uncertain because with the URL above, it will return the relationship of some user to "you", so it it getting the relationship between the userID and the user associated with the access token? If so, I don't know how you would get the relationship between two other users...

6. Now, you want to see if anyone is tagging their photos as "gelato". What URL would you use for an API call to get a list of tags that contain the word "gelato"?

GET https://api.instagram.com/v1/tags/search?q=gelato&access_token=ACCESS-TOKEN

7. From the responses to your last call, what key/value pair would you use to determine which tag is the most popular?

The "media_count": 43590 pair tells you how many media objects exist with a particular tag, so that's how we tell.

8. Once you know the most popular tag, what URL would you use to get a list of recent photos that have that tag?

GET https://api.instagram.com/v1/tags/gelato/media/recent?access_token=ACCESS-TOKEN

9. Finally, you want to let your current user add a new comment to one of those photos tagged as "gelato". What URL would you use to add a comment to a specific photo? And what type of HTTP request would you need to use?

POST curl -F 'access_token=ACCESS-TOKEN' \
     -F 'text=Gelato+is+good' \
     https://api.instagram.com/v1/media/{media-id}/comments
